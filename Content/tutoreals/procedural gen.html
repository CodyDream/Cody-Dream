    <h1>Procedural Terrain Generation in Unity: An Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Creating stunning terrains for your game can be challenging, especially
      when you want to strike the perfect balance between handcrafted
      precision and procedural generation. This article introduces an approach
      to procedural terrain generation in Unity while keeping it simple and
      efficient, leveraging the power of shaders and coroutines.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Shaders for Procedural Generation?</h2>
    <p>
      Implementing procedural terrain generation often requires generating
      complex noise like Voronoi, Perlin, or fractal noise. Unity's C# doesn't
      natively support these noises, and creating them from scratch can be
      computationally expensive. However, Unity's Shader Graph or custom
      shaders provide built-in support for such noises, making them an
      excellent choice for generating heightmaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Shaders for Performance</h2>
    <p>
      Shaders are highly optimized for parallel computation on the GPU,
      enabling them to process complex mathematical operations efficiently. By
      rendering noise to a Render Texture using a shader, we can offload the
      generation process to the GPU, significantly improving performance. Once
      the texture is generated, it can be sampled and used in terrain
      manipulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Noise generation happens in the shader and is rendered into a Render
        Texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        The texture is sampled once at the start to avoid runtime performance
        overhead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since reading texture pixels can be computationally expensive,
        coroutines are used to process the heightmap progressively without
        blocking the main thread.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Combining Procedural and Handcrafted Terrains</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most powerful aspects of this system is its flexibility to
      blend procedural generation with handcrafted elements. By defining two
      ranges on the terrain, you can set a range where procedural terrain
      applies and the set middle of that range as fully procedural. Both range
      ends mark the end of procedural blending. Heights of the base terrain
      below or above those heights are fully handcrafted.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        <strong>Please note:</strong> For best results, select the middle
        point as the average height of procedural height (so results look
        natural when blending with handcrafted terrain). Also, avoid making
        the range too big because it can make results look weird, but not too
        low because it does not leave room for good blending. You may have to
        manually blend the terrain in places where the handcrafted section
        meets the middle point.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Blending Handcrafted and Procedural Heights</h2>
    <p>The system uses a blending function that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Samples the handcrafted heights as a base.</li>
      <li>
        Blends procedural noise based on a fall-off mask and custom logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows the artist to control how much influence the handcrafted
        elements retain versus the procedural components.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>A Modular Approach to Terrain Tools</h2>
    <p>
      The script in this system also integrates with external procedural tools
      that complement the terrain generation system, enhancing the final
      output. Examples include terrain painting tools or vegetation spawners
      that add further customization and polish to your terrains.
    </p>

    <h2>Coroutine-Based Processing</h2>
    <p>
      While Shader Graph efficiently generates the noise, Unity's
      <code>Texture2D.GetPixel()</code> can be expensive when sampling pixels
      from the rendered texture. To mitigate this, the script processes
      terrain heightmaps incrementally over multiple frames using coroutines.
      This ensures that the main thread remains responsive, even for
      high-resolution terrains.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages of Using Coroutines:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoids blocking the main thread during terrain generation.</li>
      <li>Allows terrain updates to happen smoothly over multiple frames.</li>
      <li>Scales well with larger terrains or higher resolutions.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Key Takeaways for Optimizing Procedural Terrain</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Use Shaders for Noise:</b> Leverage Unity’s Shader Graph to
        generate and render noise to a texture for better performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Blend Handcrafted and Procedural:</b> Incorporate ranges where the terrain transitions
        between handcrafted features and procedural elements
        to maintain control over important terrain features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Process Incrementally:</b>Use coroutines to process terrain data without affecting the game’s runtime
        performance
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>External Tools:</b>Combine this system with procedural tools to add further customization and polish to your
        terrains.
      </li>
    </ol>
